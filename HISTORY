2000-02-07 - Working name chosen

After much spirited (and often silly) brainstorming on a project name, a working name of "Tarkin" (ala Grand Moff) is chosen
for what has now turned into a project, primarily consisting of Jack, Monty and myself.

Remember, it may be spelled T-a-r-k-i-n, but it's pronounced "VorboVision". ;)

2000-02-06 - Vector packing method implemented

First attempt at getting serious with lossless vector storage. DWT, unlike DCT, requires both spatial and magnitude components
to be retained. Pyramid vector packing devised with anticipated 40% space savings for vector coords. Tests turn out better
than expected results (between 45-50%).

2000-02-04 - First player

After showing some of the 'test strips' of the output around, Jack from Greenwitch takes an active interest in within we've
made a primitive video encoder and player with help from some code borrowed from the Vorbis project. It's slow, the
compression sucks, the output is ugly, and you can't stop the playback without a kill -SIGKILL, but it DOES work. More or
less.

2000-02-02 - Changed from 2d to 3d (motion 2d)

After witnessing a number of complaints about lack of an open-source video format on IRC (in channel #icecast), I decide to
fiddle with the DWT to see how good a result I could get if I converted the transform to use 3 dimensions. Pleasantly suprised
with the results. Some people on #icecast seem interested.

2000-02-01 - Initial Revision

Unnamed thought experiment takes form from odd thoughts brought on by too much caffiene and Tylenol 3s (trying to kill a
headache). First wavelet compression engine built, sample images sucked in as .pgm's, run through DWT and iDWT, and spit back
out. Results were enough to make me say "Huh. Cool."... but not enough to make me want to work on it much more.

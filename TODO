=== Must Haves ===

* Add codebook to compress vector magnitudes

* Add code to remove effects of zero-stuffing (padding frame boundries to fit inside ^2 constraints)

* Add color handling (HSB)

* Create framework for block transport

* Link with bzip2 library to globally compress file

* Allow import from other video types for encoder (avi, mpeg, mov, etc)

* Speed up encoder and decoder blocks

* Create player programs (X, Java, winxx)



=== Possibilities ===

* Experiment with alternate wavelet functions (How well would a 2 coeff DWT work?)
  Idea: perhaps it'll reduce DWT calculation time and increase edge sharpness

* Experiment with alternate vector packing formats (Try full 3d packing rather than z-layered 2d)
  Idea: Will 3d packing produce better overall packing? Run some tests to see if the additional 
        overhead and bits/vector of a 3rd dimension in vector counts are offset by not having as
        many 'layers' in calculation (4 as opposed to 16)

* Experiment with 'chunking' variety of video stream (32x32xz or 64x64xz blocks). 
  Idea: Reduced edge effects and faster conversion time might be acheived if smaller blocks are
        used. Also possible is more efficient representation of video due to smaller possible
        areas where motion might occur (and less motion in the smaller areas to represent)

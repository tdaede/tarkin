'Tarkin' is a work-in-progress. Our goal is to create an open source 
audiovisual streaming technology that parallels or exceeds the quality
of various proprietary "standards" currently in existance.

The project's main website will be located at http://www.tarkin.org.
News and code updates will be available there as time and code progress.

At present, Tarkin consists of:

Jack (jack@icecast.org)
Monty (monty@xiph.org)
and myself (rickf@transpect.net)

Until some serious code cleanup is done and documentation written, 
you're going to be pretty much on your own with figuring out how this
thing works. Good luck. ;)
